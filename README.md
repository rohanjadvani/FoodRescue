Food Rescue
===========

Overview
-----------
This is an Android application developed at a hackathon for the non-profit
Rescuing Leftover Cuisine. Since there was a 16 hour time limit for
coding, there are many features missing. The goal of the application was
to create a software that facilitated delivery of leftover food from participating
restaurants to nearby food kitchens. Volunteer drivers would be notified,
and an optimized route would be automatically generated.

Some details
-----------
The application consists of mostly front-end layouts since there were
some issues at 3 AM setting up a server for managing users. Locations 
and restaurants were hard-coded simply because of the time constraint.

What we would have liked to added (if there was time)
------------
* Chat feature between volunteers
* Login with Facebook to raise more awareness
* Picture confirmation that food was delivered
